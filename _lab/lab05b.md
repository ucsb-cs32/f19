# Goals

The results of Lab05a should be made visible past Lab05a's deadline. This portion of Lab05 (Lab05b) is to fix your code from Lab05a if some tests did not pass. You will now see the test cases that failed on Gradescope (if any) from Lab05a.

If your submission from Lab05a did not have any errors, then you simply need to resubmit your WordCount.cpp from Lab05a to Lab05b on Gradescope in order to receive the remaining points for Lab05.

This lab portion (Lab05b) is worth a total of 50 points (100 points total for both Lab05 parts).

# Goals

The results of Lab04a should be made visible past Lab04a's deadline. This portion of Lab04 (Lab04b) is to fix your code from Lab04a if some tests did not pass. You will see the test cases that failed on Gradescope (if any) from Lab04a.

If your submission from Lab04a did not have any errors, then you simply need to resubmit your WordCount.cpp to Lab04b on Gradescope in order to receive the remaining points for Lab04.

It is important that you fix any errors from Lab04a early this week since Lab05a is a continuation of Lab04, which you will work on this week as well.

This lab portion (Lab04b) is worth a total of 50 points (100 points total for both Lab04 parts).

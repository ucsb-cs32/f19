  <b> Yaoyi Bai (TA) </b>
  <i> "Hi, my name is Yaoyi. I am a first year PhD student in UCSB CS department under the guidance of Professor Lingqi Yan. I attained my master's degree from University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Before that, I studied for my bachelor's degree in Wuhan University in Wuhan, China. As a PhD student, my research are main about computer graphics. You might not be familiar with computer graphics. Actually it is the technology that creates computer-generated imagery (CGI) movies and animations as well as video games. I feel very excited that I am capable of becoming part of animation and video game production. Since in computer graphics we use a lot of C++ for implementation, you will find C++ extremely important and useful from CS32. Please feel free to talk with me about my research interests. Hope you guys have a wonderful quarter. " </i>

  <b> Robert McLaughlin (TA) </b>
  <i> "Hi everyone! My name is Robert (he/him/his) and I am one of your TAs for this quarter! I am a first-year PhD student interested in distributed and dynamical systems. I received my Bachelor's degree in Software Engineering from Rochester Institute of Technology in NY, and most recently spent one year working at Microsoft building Azure. I am passionate about teaching: I spent four years as a volunteer tutor at RIT, and served as president of the Society of Software Engineers, a student mentoring organization. Outside of the classroom I run, bike, hike, boulder, and read philosophy! Please feel free to come and chat with me. Have a great quarter!" </i>

    <b>Arthur Gatin (Tutor)</b>
    <i> "Hi, I'm Arthur, and I'm a second year Computer Science student. I took CS32 with Professor Wang last quarter in Spring, so I remember very well how this class was run and what you can expect to encounter in it. This quarter I'm taking three computer science courses, so, hopefully, will be able not only to explain the concepts in the way I understood them best when I took the class, but also tell you which ones will be particularly important for your next CS courses. I'm also a program lead of the Tutoring program for this quarter, so feel free to offer your feedback on your experiences with the program, or anything of the kind :). Apart from that, I'm currently running for a hall council position in Manzanita, trying to get more involved in hackathons and clubs like UCSB Robotics, IEEE, and Data Science (join me), and play games. Have 1200+ hours in Rocket League, and recently started getting better at Smash Ultimate. Feel free to talk to me and ask anything in sections, open labs, piazza, or even IRL. Hope we have a fantastic quarter together!" </i>

    <b>Helen Huang (Tutor) </b>
    <i> "Hello! My name is Helen and I am excited to be your tutor for CS 32! My pronouns are she/her/hers. I am a third-year computer science and pharmacology double major. In fact, I was admitted as a biology major and I added computer science as my second major during my sophomore year.
    I enjoy helping others understand new materials, go through tricky cases, deal with any bugs in the codes, and so on. I believe that everyone has already had some experience with coding and the language but I still encourage you to reach out to me and other tutors if you ever feel struggled or confused. I personally went to my tutors when I was taking CS32 and I not only resolved the problem of my lab but also learned some useful coding techniques from them. A short talk can be very enriching.
    Currently, I am doing research in a neuroscience lab where I maintain and update object-oriented codes that runs the automated rigs used to train and study the memory of mice. It is a very exciting experience for me as I can combine and apply my knowledge in both computer science and biology to solve real-world problems.
    Outside academics, I like to build Lego sets, make freshly-grounded coffee, take photos with a SLR camera, travel around and learn different cultures, and play tennis. All of them are pretty interesting ways to deal with pressure and relax. Hope everyone will have a great experience with this class and look forward to talking to and working with some of you!" </i>

  <b> Jacqueline Mai (Tutor) </b>
  <i> "Hi everyone! I'm Jacqui and I'm a third-year Computer Science major. This is the third course I've tutored- I've done CS 16 and CS 8 in the past. Feel free to ask me as many questions as you need in order to understand the new concepts, and I will help you as best as I can. Some other background about me: I'm currently on track to finish my undergraduate degree a year early, and I'm starting my master's next year. As part of the ERSP undergraduate research program, I worked with Professor Tim Sherwood of the ArchLab to study design patterns in hardware neural networks. Don't hesitate to talk to me or contact me privately via Piazza if you need to set up an extra meeting outside my lab hours, or if you want to talk to me about undergraduate research or graduating early!" </i>

  <b> Alan Roddick (Tutor) </b>
  <i> "Hi everyone! My name is Alan and I will be one of your tutors for CS 32. I am a third year computer science major who transferred last year from physics. Before college, I had no prior computer science experience. After I took my first computer science class, though, I loved it and was fortunate enough to get into all of the classes necessary to change into it. CS 32 was one of my favorite computer science classes, and the techniques I learned in the class helped pave the way for later classes. Taken from someone who had to catch up to most people already in the major, I know how challenging and frustrating some aspects of computer science are. Utilizing the helpful TAs and professors around me along with putting more time into a problem before I asked a question  was a main factor in me learning the material better. Outside of class, I enjoy playing sports, playing the guitar, and being outside. I generally love playing any sport, but I more frequently play baseball or go to the gym to play basketball. I also love watching sports, specifically Ohio State college football and the San Jose Sharks. My other favorite outdoor activities include hiking, kayaking, playing spikeball, and relaxing at the beach. I am looking forward to having a great quarter with you all!" </i>
